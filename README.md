## 🧠 AWS Test — Rails Deployment via EC2

### 📌 Overview  
This repo was created to **test deployment of a Ruby on Rails application using AWS EC2**. It serves as a sandbox for understanding cloud hosting, server provisioning, and environment setup for production-grade Rails apps.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails  
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS EC2  
- **Tools**: Capistrano (optional), SSH, GitHub, Linux CLI  
- **Languages**: Ruby, HTML, JavaScript, CSS

### 🚀 Purpose  
- Explore EC2 instance setup for Rails hosting  
- Test deployment flow from GitHub to AWS  
- Understand environment variables, server provisioning, and asset precompilation  
- Practice remote debugging and log inspection

### 📁 Structure Highlights  
- `Capfile`, `config/deploy.rb`: Deployment logic (if used)  
- Standard Rails folders: `app/`, `config/`, `db/`, etc.  
- `README.md`: Documents deployment strategy and steps

### 🧪 How to Use  
This repo assumes familiarity with:
- Launching EC2 instances  
- Installing Ruby, Rails, and dependencies on Ubuntu  
- Configuring Nginx or Apache (optional)  
- Setting up PostgreSQL or SQLite  
- Using SSH keys and GitHub for deployment

### 🧠 Reflection  
This project helped me explore the **bridge between development and deployment**, giving me hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and Rails production setup. It solidified my understanding of provisioning, asset handling, and remote debugging. It’s a foundational step toward mastering full-stack delivery in live environments.
